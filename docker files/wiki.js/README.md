# Introduction
Wiki.js is an excellent way to create a website, a library, or even a place where everyone can contribute their knowledge. It's a great way to share your knowledge and create tutorials.

# Info
To do this, you can take this Docker Compose file and implement it in your Docker to allow you to deploy your Wiki in production. (Note that the default port here is 3000, but you can choose to use another port at any time by modifying this file).
